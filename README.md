## Comments
I wanted to make sure the login screen was usable on mobile so the login card will change to better fit a mobile screen. Going forward, if I had more time I would spend more time creating better media queries to make sure it looks good on all screen sizes. I would also make sure that all components are reusable and add the ability to swap to a login form instead of a register form.
